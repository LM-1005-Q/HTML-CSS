          <h2>Visionary Innovator who revolutionized Technology</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Steve Paul Jobs</b> (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an
            American business magnate, industrial designer, media proprietor,
            and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the
            chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt
            Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of
            Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer
            of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along
            with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve
            Wozniak. Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and
            German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs
            attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In
            1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later
            studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to
            sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained
            fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple
            II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
            Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which
            was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led
            to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed
            by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
            computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing
            industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the
            first laser printer to feature vector graphics.

          <h3>Innovations and designs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Jobs launched the <b>Macintosh</b> on January 24, 1984, as the
              first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral
              graphical user interface and mouse.
            </li>
            <li>
              After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started
              <b>NeXT</b>, a workstation computer company. The NeXT Computer was
              introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apple <b>iMac</b> G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative
              design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple
              boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of
              anyone else's.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first generation of <b>iPod</b> was released October 23, 2001.
              The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by
              using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to
              players at that time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apple began work on the first <b>iPhone</b> in 2005 and the first
              iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a
              sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were
              aware of its release.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>iPad</b> is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed
              and marketed by Apple. The first iPad was released on April 3,
              2010.
